<!-- first block paragraph -->
<div align="center"> 
If you tried to do console program on Python more intuitive to user, but all these tries led to using some libraries with primitive console menu or tkinter wich looks like a parody of the real app. Can be used web-interface but there are some problems. 
</div> <br />

<!-- reasons why do i create this lib -->
<ul>
  <li><i>Not every user is acquaintanted to web tecnologies.</i></li>
  <li><i>If the program that you do is primitive, there is no reason to use web.</i></li>
  
  <br />This is why I decided to create this library. Python console GUI has a simple interface to maintain visual contact with the user.
</ul>
