If you tried to do console program on Python more intuitive to user, but all these tries led to using some libraries with primitive console menu or tkinter wich looks like a parody of the real app. Can be used web-interface but there are some problems.
 1. _Not every user is acquaintanted to web tecnologies._
 2. _If the program that you do is primitive, there is no reason to use web._ 

 This is why I decided to create this library. Python console GUI has a simple interface to maintain visual contact with the user.
